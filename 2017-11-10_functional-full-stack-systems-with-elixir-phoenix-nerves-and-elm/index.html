              Notes:

              This talk is about Functional Full-Stack Systems, so

              I'm going to address what I mean by each, in reverse order.

              Let's start with "Systems."

              Most systems start out as a monolith

              because the first thing you build is,

              by definition, the only thing you have.

              Recently (in the grand scheme of things),

              developers have been frequently using a

              micro-service architecture to better manage

              the scope of responsibility for particular

              pieces of code and data.

              Notes:

              Conway's law says that the architecture you choose

              will normally depend on the structure of your organization.

              So keep that in mind, while designing your software

              as well as your organization structure.

              Notes:

              Conway's Law was coined by the book TMM-M.

              As a developer, if you haven't read this book, you really should.

              One of the important concepts in it deals with the

              cost of communication in teams.

              Teams naturally start out small.

              For example, a pair of co-founders building an MVP.

              Communication is very efficient because

              there are only two brains involved

              and one lossy path between them.

              As the team grows, there are more communication paths,

              so there are more opportunities for misunderstanding

              or information that simply never gets shared.

              But for a small team, it's generally not a problem.

              As the team gets bigger,

              it needs to be partitioned somehow,

              or you'll literally spend

              all of your time in meetings.

              put a mental bookmark in that

              because we'll come back to it.

              This is what we call a "Back-End Developer."

              They write code that runs on servers,

              Often, those parts of "the stack" are outside of the developers' direct control.

              There's probably one or more vendors and a contracts involved.

              Or, for a small company, spreadsheets.

              If you're lucky, there's a vendor on the other side of the contract

              Unless this is the core of your business, there's probably no API

              and you've just got whatever the vendor provides OOTB.

              Notes:

              First of all, "Functional," to me, means that it works and that

              it recovers gracefully from errors,

              ...because computers.

              We'd really like for our systems to be "anti-fragile,"

              meaning that failure actually makes them stronger.

              The poster-child of this concept in technology

              is the Netflix Chaos Engineering team.

              By injecting failures into real production systems, engineers are

              forced to develop systems that are resilient to failure

              and improving over time.

              Notes:

              So, besides having a system that _functions_,

              I also really like systems that use a _functional programming_ style.

              It makes the code much easier to test and reason about when it consists of

              deterministic functions, always returning the same output for a given input.

              I work at Le Tote, where we enable women to always stay fashionable,

              without having to continually maintain a closet full of clothes,

              by shipping them boxes of clothing clothing on a subscription basis.

              Specifically, I work on the team that uses Elixir, Phoenix, Nerves, and React

              to make the magic happen in our fulfillment centers.

              I had some embedded systems experience and an ancient Raspberry Pi

              that I had barely even turned on since buying it, so

              I spent a while struggling through the process to get a Nerves

              firmware running on it, and it was _so exciting_ when I finally saw

              that iex shell booting up in just a few seconds on my device.

              new person to our Slack channel and invite them to chat about

              what brought them to the community.

              out to some of the existing core team members on Slack and let

              them know that I wanted to start contributing in these ways, and

              The community has grown significantly over the past couple of years.

              We have over 1300 members in our Slack channel, but I see that as

              only the tip of the iceberg. There are probably many more people

              who have tried Nerves or are interested, but they aren't familiar

              with Slack or don't want to engage in that way.

              We've recently been working to have a stronger presence in

              other spaces like the Elixir Forum and Stack Overflow so that we

              can do better at meeting people where they are.

              Notes:

              For the back-end, you choice of web framework will tend toward

              the popular choices for the language you want to use.

              (fragment) For Ruby, it's often Rails

              (fragment) If you like writing JavaScript, you might use NodeJS

              (fragment) If you're into Clojure... well, it's just functions,

              so why would you want a web framework?

              (framework) For functional full-stack systems, I think

              Elixir and Phoenix have a lot going for them.

              Notes:

              Due to its Erlang roots, Elixir was born to be embedded.

              The embedded systems we have today would have been considered

              supercomputers when the BEAM was being designed, so it's not

              surprising that it runs well on low-cost hardware.

            <aside class="notes" data-markdown>
              Let's talk about why per-process garbage-collection matters.

              If we have a JVM that's under a constant workload, its memory

              usage profile will probably look like this.

              It grows for a while, then suddenly drops before growing again.

              The shaded areas are wasted memory because they were temporarily

              allocated to do some work, but weren't freed when they're no longer

              needed, because it's difficult to tell whether they're still in use

              somewhere else.

          <section data-background-image="img/gc_jvm_zoom.png" data-background-size="contain">
            <aside class="notes" data-markdown>
              If we zoom in, we see that it is also continually doing this same

              clean-up process, but on a smaller scale, to keep memory usage

              in-check between Full-GCs.

              When the overall memory usage hits 75%, it triggers a Full-GC that

              stops the whole VM while it determines what memory is no longer

              referenced anywhere and frees it up. In a busy system with a lot of

              memory, this can take a considerable about of time and cause

              performance problems.

          <section data-background-image="img/gc_beam.png" data-background-size="contain">
            <aside class="notes" data-markdown>
              By contrast, the BEAM does garbage-collection on a per-process basis,

              so there's not much discernable memory-waste for a system under

              constant load. The overall memory usage only ebbs and flows with

              the actual memory requirements of your workload.

              This means that you can run a system closer to its memory limit,

              provided that your workload doesn't have large peaks and valleys.

              That can be a very important property for an embedded system with

              only half a gig of RAM.

          <section data-background-image="img/gc_beam_zoom.png" data-background-size="contain">
            <aside class="notes" data-markdown>
              If we zoom in, we see that this is due to each process allocating

              some memory as it does its work, garbage-collecting along the way,

              and freeing it all when it's finished.

              At any moment in time, there are a bunch of processes allocating a

              small increment of memory, while a much smaller number are freeing

              their entire allocation.

              So the net result is that the overall memory usage responds very

              quickly to the demand on the system.
